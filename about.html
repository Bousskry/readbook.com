		<p>ReadBook was established in 2021 with the vision to provide an extensive library of books in digital format for free on the Internet. Many of the early eBooks are from the Kutub archives, which means you will be able to find a lot of classics on the site.</p>
		<p>we are still going strong in our mission to provide a valuable service to our readers. ReadBook has grown into a platform where self-publishing authors have the opportunity to introduce their work to our community and new books are uploaded to our site daily - provided they comply to our quality standards.</p>
		<p>In our daily newsletter, we keep our rapidly growing list of active subscribers up to date on the latest free and discounted eBooks that are available online. We always love to hear from our visitors, so if you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to contact our editor contact@readbook.com.</p>
